 Provide a forecast of the daily withdrawn amount per unit for each of the  days 2009-02-02 till 2009-03-01
Task description: Provide a forecast of the daily withdrawn amount per unit for each of the 
days 2009-02-02 till 2009-03-01. There is no need to deep dive into sophisticated statistical 
forecasting methods, even a naive forecasting procedure based on using observable patterns 
(weekly/monthly/yearly seasonality plus festivities) is sufficient to come up with a forecasting 
of good quality. Alternatively, to the naive forecast you can also work with random forecasts 
(RF) to obtain forecast in a straightforward way (keep in mind, however, that also for making 
RFs work you need to preselect relevant features).  
Proceed in the standard way of a data analytics project: (I) First produce graphics providing 
an informative overview of the data and the afore-mentioned observable patterns, (II) develop 
ideas how to forecast (i.e., detect patterns and relevant features) , and (III) implement and test 
your ideas (since only data till 2009-02-01 is included, you could use your forecasting and - 
based on the data till October 2008 - forecast November 2008 to evaluate the performance).
